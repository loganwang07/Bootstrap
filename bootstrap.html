      <div class="alert alert-info">
        I once encountered a homeless man who asked me to spare a rupee. He said "If you give me a rupee, God will bless you with 10 thousand." I said to him "clearly, you need the 10 thousand more than I do. Iâ€™ll gladly take your money!" â€” Karunesh Talwar

          <strong>The Set-Up</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>the premise on which the joke is told</li>
            <li>sets up the listener to anticipate something</li>
            <li>can be an unusual fact, an incident (made up or real), or an observation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          <strong>Detail</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>add your details and escalate your story</li>
            <li>should be a crisp, one-line statement</li>
            <li>details can be fluid but must be immediately relevant</li>

          <strong>Punchline</strong>

      <p>Here is an example of a joke by Louis CK.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Set-Up:</span> You know whatâ€™s amazing to me, you can name your kid anything you want.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Detail:</span> There are NO laws (around naming a kid). There should be at least a couple of laws. None. You can literally name your kid anything. You can name your kid a name without vowels if you like â€” PNSNDLTN.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Punchline:</span> Iâ€™d like to name my kid a whole phrase. Iâ€™ll call him Ladies and Gentlemen. This is my son, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 class="header">Puns</h2>
      <br>
      <p>A pun, also known as paronomasia, is a form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect (Wikipedia definition). Puns have a long history in human writing. For example, the Roman playwright Plautus was famous for his puns and word games.</p>
      <div class="alert alert-info">
        <mark>Fun Fact:</mark> Shakespeare used over 3,000 puns in his plays. Surprisingly, Elizabethan literature considered puns and wordplay to be a "sign of literary refinement" more so than humor.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>What do you call a mean crook going down stairs? A condescending con, descending.</li>
        <li>I had a dream I was swimming in a pool of soda. Too bad it was just a Fanta sea.</li>
        <li>What did the grape say when he got stepped on? Nothing, he just let out a little wine.</li>
        <li>Why could the mathematician only work from home? Because he could only function in his domain.</li>
        <li>Did you know that I'm really good at bowling? It's right up my alley.</li>
        <li>What happens when a parsley farmer gets sued? They garnish his wages.</li>
        <li>How does Moses make his coffee? Hebrews it.</li>
        <li>How was the Roman Empire split in two? With a pair of Caesars.</li>
        <li>Did you hear about the cheese factory that caught fire? There was nothing left but de brie.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Books Never Written</h4>
      <p>Sometimes called "books never written" or "world's greatest books", these are jokes which consist of fictitious book titles with authors' names that contain a pun relating to the title. Perhaps the best-known example is: "Tragedy on the Cliff by Eileen Dover", which according to one source was devised by humourist Peter DeVries (1910-1993).</p>
      <div class="alert alert-info">
        <mark>Fun Fact:</mark> Did you know that the Tanakh (the first five books of the Bible) <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ThA8AAAAIAAJ&q=%22pun+forms+the+tie%22&pg=PA1#v=snippet&q=%22pun%20forms%20the%20tie%22&f=false" class="alert-link" target="_blank">contains puns</a>?

      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 class="header">One-liners</h2>
      <br>
      <p>A one-liner is a joke delivered concisely and meant to be pithy and meaningful. As a result, it is very popular with comedians, such as Groucho Marx and Henny Youngman.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My girlfriend makes me want to be a better person - so I can get a better girlfriend.</li>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 class="header">Anti-jokes</h2>
      <br>
      <p>An anti-joke is a type of humor in which the joke-teller says something that is intentionally unfunny. It usually relies on the audience's expectation of something humorous, and the irony of it not being funny is what provides the comedic value.</p>
      <div class="alert alert-info">
        <mark>Fun Fact:</mark> A prank form of an anti-joke, known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xduTMrUTqI" class="alert-link" target="_blank">no soap radio</a> was popularized in 1950s New York.
      </div>
      <p><b>The obvious punchline</b> is structured like a traditional joke, but its punchline is the most obvious to the narrative.<p>
      <ul>

        <li>What do you call a pencil sharpener that can't sharpen pencils? Broken.</li>

        <li>I can still remember my Grandpa's last words before he kicked the bucket. He said, "Hey, how far do you think I can kick this bucket?"</li>
        <li>You know what's really odd? Numbers that aren't divisible by two.</li>
        <li>What's yellow and is something you shouldn't drink? A school bus.</li>
        <li>What did the cowboy say at his second rodeo? "This ain't my first rodeo!"</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The inobvious punchline</b> contains a set-up suggesting a certain (usually risquÃ©) punchline, but whose actual ending is the opposite of what the listener was anticipating.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Did you hear about the honeymooners who confused the tube of K-Y Jelly with window putty? Quite the tragedy, all the windows fell out of their new home.</li>
